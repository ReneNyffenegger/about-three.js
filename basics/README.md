### Coordinate System

coordinates.html demonstrates the coordiante system of three.js:

- The white cube is at the origin (0, 0, 0).
- The x-axis (red cube) goes to right
- The y-axis (green cube) goes up
- The z-axis (blue cube) comes out of the window.

The camera is therefore also placed with a positive z (x: -0.8, y: 1.4, z: 4.0).
